# master-thesis-pathfinding-algorithms
Master Thesis - Implementation of 4 Pathfinding Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra and A*) i python programming language using pygame library. Functionality of all algorithms are shown in square grids with interactive fields. There are 2 types of grids - open spaces and maze with random generator that crates different grid every time.
